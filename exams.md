## Exam guidelines


### How

- There will not be written tests, only an oral exam.
- A list of coding assignments is provided below. **Examinable** means I might ask you that; **optional** means I won't.
- Show up at the exam with all these pieces of code *committed to your git fork*  (see [L01](lectures/L01_introduction.ipynb) for a git primer).  

Exams proceed as follows:

1. I will first pick one of your coding assignments and ask you to introduce it.
2. The discussion then naturally moves on to other topics, with broader questions on the material we covered during the class.
3. I will then ask you to pick a coding assignment of your choice (another one) and introduce it. This is up to you! You could pick the one you liked the most, the one you're most proud of, the one that is closer to your targeted research area, etc.

Each of these three parts usually lasts about 15 minutes, for a total of 45-ish minutes. 

### When

- Exams are by appointment only (the official exam dates are nominal) and take place in my office, U2-2007. Please send me an email and we'll find a suitable day/time ([davide.gerosa@unimib.it](mailto:davide.gerosa@unimib.it)).
- As for all exams here, you're welcome to come with a witness. 
- I’m very happy to be flexible with the exam dates and I value your time; this applies to your side as well. If you’re not as prepared as you’d like and decide to decline the result, that’s okay, but I will ask you to wait about 2 months before coming back. This is equivalent to 6 exam attempts (*"appelli"*) per year.


### Important: don't overdo it!

- Coding assignments are not marked beforehand, so you don't need to submit them in advance. Just have them ready and committed when you come for the exam, that's all. 
-  **You do not need to write fully fledged and cleaned notebooks where your re-write the theory background etc.** This is a 6-CFU class and should correspond to a commensurate workload. 
- You're not writing a thesis or a paper: focus on the scientific content and don't get sidetracked with time-consuming clean up tasks. These are explorations of datasets, not essays.
- As a guideline, your notebooks should not be cleaner than those of my solutions (and as you will see, they're kind of rough...)
